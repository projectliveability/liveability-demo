#1.Open cloud shell  and export and set the project

export PROJECT_ID="project-liveability-demo"   
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
git clone https://github.com/projectliveability/liveability-demo

#2.bash to create service account for cloud build
cd liveability-demo
bash CloudBuild_SvcAccount_Setup.sh

#3.Create a composer

#4.Create trigger for intial setup. Use "initial_account_setup_cloudbuild.yaml"
#5. Create trigger for terraform. "Use terraform-cloudbuild.yaml"
#6.create trigger for tables.Use "ddl_cloudbuild.yaml"
#7.Create trigger for DAG copy
#8.create trigger for datastream. Use "datastream_cloudbuild.yaml"

till here we will be setting up before the demo

In demo
----------
Step 1: Initial Setup (Tim)
1. Open Project Dashboard, two APIs, Service Account, Cloud Storage. Confirm Cloud Build API and IAM API are enabled. 
2. Click on Cloud Build for Initial Setup
3. Show APIs disabled - Dataflow API and Pub/Sub API
4. Show service account for project not created
5. Show cloud storage not created.
6. After Cloud build job is complete, go back to the same tabs. SHow APIs enabled, Service Account created, Cloud Storage with data, ddl and credential folders. 

Step 2: Terraform (Tim)
1. Click the trigger for terraform

Step 3: Table Creation (Jannet)
1.click the trigger for table creation
2. Show BigQuery Tables

Step 4: Dataflow for Batch Job (Jannet) 
1. Cloud Storage - data 
2. Open Dataflow 
3. Open Cloud Composer. Click on DAGs folder to open. 
4. Cloud Build open - trigger job to upload dags to DAG folder. 
_DAGS_FOLDER = gs://....../ (don't forget to put the / at the end) (Note:- get the DAGs path from DAG folder)
History - show job is successful.
Show DAGs folder. All DAGs should be present. 
5. Composer - Open Airflow Click on the trigger for DAG copy
--> click on Airflow UI--> admin--> variables-->enter the below one by one
    -->GCS_BUCKET= gs://project-liveability-demo
    -->LOCATION =  australia-southeast1
    -->PROJECT_ID = project-liveability-demo
Go back to Airflow. 
Manually trigger sportsclub.
If required - religious organisation is the next trigger. 
Go to Dataflow -> Show the steps that are running. 
Finally go to BigQuery and show the tables have data loaded. Have a query ready to display data. 

Step 5: Streaming Input (Jannet, Tim)
1. In project-liveability-demo, Open Appsheet, Cloud Build, Datastream, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Cloud SQL and HLD
In project-liveability-final, open Dataflow, BigQuery

2. In project-liveability-demo.
Open first Appsheet - Liveability1, Have the addresses that has to be input. Ensure to put the post code again in current/new/work address.
current address: 134 Manningham Road.Bulleen.3105
new address: 76 Elwood Street.Brighton.3186
work address: 28 Dorrington St.Greenvale.3059
Do not submit.
2. Go to Cloud Build, click the trigger for datastream.
3. Go to HLD. Confirm Datastream has started. Show Pub/Sub, Dataflow.
4. Come back to Appsheet and submit. 
5. Go to project-liveability-final.
6. Open CloudSQL via Cloud shell in Final project. Enter the following commands in Cloud shell-
   export PROJECT_ID="project-liveability-final"
   gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
   gcloud sql connect liveability-mysql-instance --user=appsheet --quiet
   Once prompted, enter the password 12345678 and show the user entry in cloudSQL by entering -
   Select * From db_liveability.user_activity Order by created_date Desc Limit 1;
7. Go to BigQuery and show that entry has been inserted. 


Step 6: DBT for Transformations
1. In old project: project-liveability-final 
    Open BigQuery, DBT Batch Data - Job Run, DBT User Output - Job Run, DBT Analytics Output - Development, Appsheet for Output, GeoViz, Data Studio Report

DBT - https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/accounts/109389/settings/
Appsheet - https://www.appsheet.com/Template/AppDef?appName=Liveability-1002015676&appId=62b0066d-439a-490e-b6cf-73374af153af&quickStart=False#Home
GeoViz - Manually Open using Export Data from BQ
Data Studio Report - https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ac01d986-5ad7-490d-a61d-59eea8bceb78/page/tEnnC

2. Show BQ tables.
3. Run the Batch job. When job is complete, go back to BQ and check transform_batchdata is ready

Show Data Studio Report and click on Refresh. 


Now run dataflow (not able to figure out how to use cloud composer to trigger till now)
--------------------
cd ..
cd liveability-demo
cd dataflow
bash dataflow_run.sh

Then in the already set up project
--------------------
show DBT, datastudio and geoviz
Then show the result in app sheet too


If the git clone asks for username and pwd
-----------------------------------------
